The .NET assembly compiled from codes in this folder wraps Vrmac.dll on Windows, or libVrmac.so on Linux, into .NET API.The Windows DLL contains Direct3D 12 build of the diligent engine.It requires an AMD64 CPU that support SSE up to and including 4.1, also FMA and FP16C instruiction sets.The Linux *.so contains GLES 3.1 build for ARMv7.Only tested on Raspberry Pi4, but in terms of instructions I use NEON a lot, including 16-bit FP in a few places.Both builds contain many major changes compared to Diligent engine.One reason for these changes — adapting the API for .NET.Just an example, .NET crashes instead of handling C++ exceptions, and Diligent engine uses them a lot for error handling. In my fork of it, I've exposed parallel API which uses interop-friendly HRESULT codes instead of C++ exceptions.Another reason is new features.These include 2D graphics support, FreeType integration, Linux DRM/KMS support, input and threading infrastructure, SIMD utilities, mesh indexing and normals generation, C preprocessor for GLSL, and more.About half of the native code is inherited from Diligent or its dependencies.
