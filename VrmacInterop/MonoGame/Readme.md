Initially, the code is from [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) (MIT license)Reworked heavily since then.1. MonoGame appears abandoned, ignores new .NET features, [MathF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.mathf?view=netcore-3.1) is probably the most useful of them.The formatting was questionable to say the least, with endless `#region`-s.2. Diligent engine needs slightly different projection and look at matrices.Projection ones are even different between GL and D3D.3. Some useful methods were missing, e.g. no easy way to apply angular velocity to quaternion.If you wonder why I’m not using [System.Numerics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics?view=netcore-2.1) — because structures from there lack `[StructLayout( LayoutKind.Sequential )]` which is a requirement for unmanaged interop.And given Microsoft’s stance on backward compatibility, not sure they ever fix it.
