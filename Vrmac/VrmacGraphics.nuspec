		<releaseNotes>Two improvements in this release.

1. Removed the majority of MonoGame code, replaced with equivalents from .NET runtime.
Also removed my 3x2 matrix structure, again replaced with Matrix3x2 from .NET. Size of VrmacInterop.dll reduced by half as the result.

2. Improved filled meshes. Remeshing them with Delaunay-like algorithm. Not precisely Delaunay, can’t afford it performance-wise, but I do use the same formula for flipping these quads. The algorithm is original research.
Besides remeshing, the transparent portion of meshes now have about twice as few triangles and vertices, help with rendering performance.
VAA quality of filled meshes improved as well.</releaseNotes>
